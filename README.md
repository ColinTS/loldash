# loldash
In this exercise you will reimplement some functions in a popular utility library called Lodash! 
These exercises will help you solidify the concept of 'functions' in javascript; the difference between
declaring, calling and passing them into other functions as parameters.  These are also examples of 'Higher Order' functions.

##Setup:
1. First we need to set up your development environment.  
1. Follow the instructions in this link: https://github.com/devleague/DevLeague-Modules/blob/master/Day0/installFest.md
1. Fork this repository to your own github account.
1. Clone the repository down to your local machine.
1. Use iTerm2 to navigate into the directory you cloned the repository into.
1. type in `npm install`.  This installs all the packages that the repository depends on.
1. Open up `loldash.js` with Sublime and start coding.
1. To verify that your implementation passes, go into your terminal, navigate to the repository directory
   and type in `npm test`.  All green means all tests passing!
1. Make all tests pass! And be sure to save your code in sublime before you do `npm test` each time.



##Notes:
1. Running tests are a very important part of software development!  In this exercise you are using tests that
   somebody else wrote.  In the dev league course, you folks will learn how to write them!
2. Setting up a development environment for the first time can sometimes be a daunting task and take time! This is normal and a very important part of being a web engineer.
